# Marching Squares Demo

This is a basic demonstration of the Marching Squares algorithm using C# and OpenCVSharp. The algorithm is commonly used for generating isocontours from a grid of scalar values.

## Features
- Visualizes the Marching Squares algorithm in action.
- Interactive controls to show grid, draw marching square lines, and modify the grid.

## Controls
- **Q**: Toggle grid.
- **W**: Toggle marching square lines.
- **E**: Remove 1x1 squares from the grid.
- **R**: Fill in the grid with values.
- **Space**: Create a new grid (reset the grid and start fresh).
